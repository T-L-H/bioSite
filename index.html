    <p class="dameInfoTextParagraphs">Dame is a musician and student who has quickly discovered how powerful creativity can be in making others feel understood. He began playing guitar less than a year ago, not expecting it to become such an important part of his life. What started with learning chords and simple songs turned into a passion he now canâ€™t imagine being without. Today, he owns six guitars and is always looking to grow his collection. Alongside guitar, he sometimes explores rap, drawing inspiration from NF, while his singing and guitar-based songs are influenced by Powfu. These different styles give him the freedom to express emotions in ways that resonate with many people.</p>
    <p class="dameInfoTextParagraphs">In 2024, Dame graduated from high school, closing one chapter and opening another as he moved into college. He decided to study Psychology, a choice deeply tied to his values and experiences. Having known what it feels like to be overlooked, Dame wants to help others feel seen. Psychology provides him with tools to understand people on a deeper level, and he hopes to combine that knowledge with his music to support others in both practical and creative ways.</p>
