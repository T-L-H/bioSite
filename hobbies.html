    <p>Tell me about yourself!<br>
A: My name is Dame. I play guitar, write songs, and make content around music. I just graduated high school in 2024, and I’m now studying Psychology in college.
<br>
How did you first get into guitar?<br>
A: I picked it up coming up on a year ago. I didn’t expect to love it so much, but I really did. I think I’ve gotten pretty decent, and now I own six guitars and I keep adding more.
<br>
What kind of music inspires you the most?<br>
A: I do rap from time to time and I’m inspired by NF for that. When it comes to guitar and singing songs, Powfu is a big inspiration for me.
<br>
What role does songwriting play in your life?<br>
A: I do it to portray my emotions and to try and make other people feel seen.

    <p>How does making content tie into your music?<br>
A: Content gives me a way to share the process, not just polished songs but little riffs, ideas, and my personality. It makes me feel closer to people who watch.
<br>


 You just graduated high school in 2024. how did that feel?<br>
A: Honestly, it was exciting. I felt proud, but at the same time it felt like I was already looking ahead at what’s next.
<br>
Why did you choose Psychology in college?<br>
A: I want other people to feel seen, because I know what it’s like to feel invisible. I’ve always liked helping people, and Psychology felt like the best way to do that.

    <p>
What are some of your goals moving forward?<br>
A: I’d love to release an album someday and also help people through psychology, maybe as a counselor. I want both paths to overlap, using music and psychology to help people feel understood.
<br>
What do you enjoy most about creating?<br>
A: Being able to know that I helped someone if they related to my song.
<br>
If people remember one thing about you, what would you want it to be?<br>
A: That I cared about making people feel heard, valued, and not alone.
